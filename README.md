# 👋 Hi, I’m Giovana 🐱

Welcome to my GitHub!

🎓 Systems Engineer by degree, Software Engineer by profession.  
💻 Passionate about building scalable, user-friendly, and secure applications.  

I specialize in **Fullstack Development** with experience in frontend (React, Next.js, WordPress, UI/UX) and backend (Laravel, PHP, AWS, RDS, APIs, microservices).  
I enjoy turning ideas into products — from designing intuitive interfaces to deploying cloud-based solutions.
